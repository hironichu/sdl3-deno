/**
 * # CategoryDialog
 *
 * File dialog support.
 *
 * SDL offers file dialogs, to let users select files with native GUI
 * interfaces. There are "open" dialogs, "save" dialogs, and folder selection
 * dialogs. The app can control some details, such as filtering to specific
 * files, or whether multiple files can be selected by the user.
 *
 * Note that launching a file dialog is a non-blocking operation; control
 * returns to the app immediately, and a callback is called later (possibly in
 * another thread) when the user makes a choice.

 * Displays a dialog that lets the user select a file on their filesystem.

 *
 * The callback will be invoked with a null-terminated list of files the user
 * chose. The list will be empty if the user canceled the dialog, and it will
 * be NULL if an error occurred.
 *
 * Note that the callback may be called from a different thread than the one
 * the function was invoked on.
 *
 * Depending on the platform, the user may be allowed to input paths that
 * don't yet exist.
 *
 * On Linux, dialogs may require XDG Portals, which requires DBus, which
 * requires an event-handling loop. Apps that do not use SDL to handle events
 * should add a call to SDL_PumpEvents in their main loop.

 *                 file and accepts, or cancels the dialog, or an error

 * @param userdata an optional pointer to pass extra data to the callback when
 *                 it will be invoked.
 * @param window the window that the dialog should be modal for, may be NULL.
 *               Not all platforms support this option.
 * @param filters a list of filters, may be NULL. Not all platforms support
 *                this option, and platforms that do support it may allow the
 *                user to ignore the filters. If non-NULL, it must remain
 *                valid at least until the callback is invoked.
 * @param nfilters the number of filters. Ignored if filters is NULL.
 * @param default_location the default folder or file to start the dialog at,
 *                         may be NULL. Not all platforms support this option.
 * @param allow_many if non-zero, the user will be allowed to select multiple
 *                   entries. Not all platforms support this option.
 *
 * @threadsafety This function should be called only from the main thread. The
