/**
 * # CategoryLog
 *
 * Simple log messages with priorities and categories. A message's
 * SDL_LogPriority signifies how important the message is. A message's
 * SDL_LogCategory signifies from what domain it belongs to. Every category
 * has a minimum priority specified: when a message belongs to that category,
 * it will only be sent out if it has that minimum priority or higher.
 *
 * SDL's own logs are sent below the default priority threshold, so they are
 * quiet by default.
 *
 * You can change the log verbosity programmatically using
 * SDL_SetLogPriority() or with SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_LOGGING, ...), or with
 * the "SDL_LOGGING" environment variable. This variable is a comma separated
 * set of category=level tokens that define the default logging levels for SDL
 * applications.
 *
 * The category can be a numeric category, one of "app", "error", "assert",
 * "system", "audio", "video", "render", "input", "test", or `*` for any
 * unspecified category.
 *
 * The level can be a numeric level, one of "trace", "verbose", "debug",
 * "info", "warn", "error", "critical", or "quiet" to disable that category.
 *
 * You can omit the category if you want to set the logging level for all
 * categories.
 *
 * If this hint isn't set, the default log levels are equivalent to:
 *
 * `app=info,assert=warn,test=verbose,*=error`
 *
 * Here's where the messages go on different platforms:
 *
 * - Windows: debug output stream
 * - Android: log output
 * - Others: standard error output (stderr)
 *
 * You don't need to have a newline (`\n`) on the end of messages, the
 * functions will do that for you. For consistent behavior cross-platform, you
 * shouldn't have any newlines in messages, such as to log multiple lines in
 * one call; unusual platform-specific behavior can be observed in such usage.
 * Do one log call per line instead, with no newlines in messages.
 *
 * Each log call is atomic, so you won't see log messages cut off one another
 * when logging from multiple threads.
