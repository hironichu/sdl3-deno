/**
 * # CategoryFilesystem
 *
 * SDL offers an API for examining and manipulating the system's filesystem.
 * This covers most things one would need to do with directories, except for
 * actual file I/O (which is covered by [CategoryIOStream](CategoryIOStream)
 * and [CategoryAsyncIO](CategoryAsyncIO) instead).
 *
 * There are functions to answer necessary path questions:
 *
 * - Where is my app's data? SDL_GetBasePath().
 * - Where can I safely write files? SDL_GetPrefPath().
 * - Where are paths like Downloads, Desktop, Music? SDL_GetUserFolder().
 * - What is this thing at this location? SDL_GetPathInfo().
 * - What items live in this folder? SDL_EnumerateDirectory().
 * - What items live in this folder by wildcard? SDL_GlobDirectory().
 * - What is my current working directory? SDL_GetCurrentDirectory().
 *
 * SDL also offers functions to manipulate the directory tree: renaming,
 * removing, copying files.
 *

 * Callback for directory enumeration.
 *
 * Enumeration of directory entries will continue until either all entries
 * have been provided to the callback, or the callback has requested a stop
 * through its return value.
 *
 * Returning SDL_ENUM_CONTINUE will let enumeration proceed, calling the
 * callback with further entries. SDL_ENUM_SUCCESS and SDL_ENUM_FAILURE will
 * terminate the enumeration early, and dictate the return value of the
 * enumeration function itself.
 *
 * `dirname` is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\\' on Windows, '/'
 * on most other platforms).
 *
 * @param userdata an app-controlled pointer that is passed to the callback.
 * @param dirname the directory that is being enumerated.
 * @param fname the next entry in the enumeration.
 * @returns how the enumeration should proceed.
 *
 * @since This datatype is available since SDL 3.2.0.
