/**
 * # CategoryTimer
 *
 * SDL provides time management functionality. It is useful for dealing with
 * (usually) small durations of time.
 *
 * This is not to be confused with _calendar time_ management, which is
 * provided by [CategoryTime](CategoryTime).
 *
 * This category covers measuring time elapsed (SDL_GetTicks(),
 * SDL_GetPerformanceCounter()), putting a thread to sleep for a certain
 * amount of time (SDL_Delay(), SDL_DelayNS(), SDL_DelayPrecise()), and firing
 * a callback function after a certain amount of time has elasped
 * (SDL_AddTimer(), etc).
 *
 * There are also useful macros to convert between time units, like
 * SDL_SECONDS_TO_NS() and such.
