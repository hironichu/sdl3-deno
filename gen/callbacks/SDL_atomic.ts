 * Atomic operations.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If you are not an expert in concurrent lockless programming, you
 * should not be using any functions in this file. You should be protecting
 * your data structures with full mutexes instead.
 *
 * ***Seriously, here be dragons!***
 *
 * You can find out a little more about lockless programming and the subtle
 * issues that can arise here:
 * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/lockless-programming
 *
 * There's also lots of good information here:

 * - https://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms
 * - https://preshing.com/
 *
 * These operations may or may not actually be implemented using processor
 * specific atomic operations. When possible they are implemented as true
 * processor specific atomic operations. When that is not possible the are
 * implemented using locks that *do* use the available atomic operations.
 *
 * All of the atomic operations that modify memory are full memory barriers.
