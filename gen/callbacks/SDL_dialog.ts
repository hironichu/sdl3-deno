/**
 * # CategoryDialog
 *
 * File dialog support.
 *
 * SDL offers file dialogs, to let users select files with native GUI
 * interfaces. There are "open" dialogs, "save" dialogs, and folder selection
 * dialogs. The app can control some details, such as filtering to specific
 * files, or whether multiple files can be selected by the user.
 *
 * Note that launching a file dialog is a non-blocking operation; control
 * returns to the app immediately, and a callback is called later (possibly in
 * another thread) when the user makes a choice.
 */

export const callbacks = {
/**
 * Callback used by file dialog functions.
 *
 * The specific usage is described in each function.
 *
 * If `filelist` is:
 *
 * - NULL, an error occurred. Details can be obtained with SDL_GetError().
 * - A pointer to NULL, the user either didn't choose any file or canceled the
 *   dialog.
 * - A pointer to non-`NULL`, the user chose one or more files. The argument
 *   is a null-terminated array of pointers to UTF-8 encoded strings, each
 *   containing a path.
 *
 * The filelist argument should not be freed; it will automatically be freed
 * when the callback returns.
 *
 * The filter argument is the index of the filter that was selected, or -1 if
 * no filter was selected or if the platform or method doesn't support
 * fetching the selected filter.
 *
 * In Android, the `filelist` are `content://` URIs. They should be opened
 * using SDL_IOFromFile() with appropriate modes. This applies both to open
 * and save file dialog.
 *
 * @param userdata an app-provided pointer, for the callback's use.
 * @param filelist the file(s) chosen by the user.
 * @param filter index of the selected filter.
 *
 * @since This datatype is available since SDL 3.2.0.
