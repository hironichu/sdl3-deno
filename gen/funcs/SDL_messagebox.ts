/**
 * # CategoryMessagebox
 *
 * SDL offers a simple message box API, which is useful for simple alerts,
 * such as informing the user when something fatal happens at startup without
 * the need to build a UI for it (or informing the user _before_ your UI is
 * ready).
 *
 * These message boxes are native system dialogs where possible.
 *
 * There is both a customizable function (SDL_ShowMessageBox()) that offers
 * lots of options for what to display and reports on what choice the user
 * made, and also a much-simplified version (SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox()),
 * merely takes a text message and title, and waits until the user presses a
 * single "OK" UI button. Often, this is all that is necessary.
