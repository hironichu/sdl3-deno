/**
 * # CategoryFilesystem
 *
 * SDL offers an API for examining and manipulating the system's filesystem.
 * This covers most things one would need to do with directories, except for
 * actual file I/O (which is covered by [CategoryIOStream](CategoryIOStream)
 * and [CategoryAsyncIO](CategoryAsyncIO) instead).
 *
 * There are functions to answer necessary path questions:
 *
 * - Where is my app's data? SDL_GetBasePath().
 * - Where can I safely write files? SDL_GetPrefPath().
 * - Where are paths like Downloads, Desktop, Music? SDL_GetUserFolder().
 * - What is this thing at this location? SDL_GetPathInfo().
 * - What items live in this folder? SDL_EnumerateDirectory().
 * - What items live in this folder by wildcard? SDL_GlobDirectory().
 * - What is my current working directory? SDL_GetCurrentDirectory().
 *
 * SDL also offers functions to manipulate the directory tree: renaming,
 * removing, copying files.

/**
 * Get the directory where the application was run from.
 *
 * SDL caches the result of this call internally, but the first call to this
 * function is not necessarily fast, so plan accordingly.
 *
 * **macOS and iOS Specific Functionality**: If the application is in a ".app"
 * bundle, this function returns the Resource directory (e.g.
 * MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/). This behaviour can be overridden by adding
 * a property to the Info.plist file. Adding a string key with the name
 * SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE with a supported value will change the
 * behaviour.
 *
 * Supported values for the SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE property (Given an
 * application in /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app):
 *
 * - `resource`: bundle resource directory (the default). For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources`
 * - `bundle`: the Bundle directory. For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/`
 * - `parent`: the containing directory of the bundle. For example:
 *   `/Applications/SDLApp/`
 *
 * **Nintendo 3DS Specific Functionality**: This function returns "romfs"
 * directory of the application as it is uncommon to store resources outside
 * the executable. As such it is not a writable directory.
 *
 * The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\\' on
 * Windows, '/' on most other platforms).
 *
 * @returns an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding to the application data
 *          directory. NULL will be returned on error or when the platform
 *          doesn't implement this functionality, call SDL_GetError() for more
 *          information.

 *
 * Get the "pref dir". This is meant to be where users can write personal
 * files (preferences and save games, etc) that are specific to your

 *
 * This function will decide the appropriate location in the native
 * filesystem, create the directory if necessary, and return a string of the
 * absolute path to the directory in UTF-8 encoding.
 *
 * On Windows, the string might look like:
 *
 * `C:\\Users\\bob\\AppData\\Roaming\\My Company\\My Program Name\\`
 *
 * On Linux, the string might look like:
 *
 * `/home/bob/.local/share/My Program Name/`
 *

 * to write files (and that SDL_GetBasePath(), while it might be writable, or
 * even the parent of the returned path, isn't where you should be writing

 * - Try to use the same org string (_including case-sensitivity_) for all
 *   your applications that use this function.
 * - Always use a unique app string for each one, and make sure it never
 *   changes for an app once you've decided on it.
 * - Unicode characters are legal, as long as they are UTF-8 encoded, but...
 * - ...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like "Game
 *   Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.

 * significant time for large files on slow disks. On some platforms, the copy
 * can be handed off to the OS itself, but on others SDL might just open both
 * paths, and read from one and write to the other.
 *
 * Note that this is not an atomic operation! If something tries to read from
 * `newpath` while the copy is in progress, it will see an incomplete copy of
 * the data, and if the calling thread terminates (or the power goes out)
 * during the copy, `newpath`'s previous contents will be gone, replaced with
 * an incomplete copy of the data. To avoid this risk, it is recommended that
 * the app copy to a temporary file in the same directory as `newpath`, and if
 * the copy is successful, use SDL_RenamePath() to replace `newpath` with the
 * temporary file. This will ensure that reads of `newpath` will either see a
 * complete copy of the data, or it will see the pre-copy state of `newpath`.
 *
 * This function attempts to synchronize the newly-copied data to disk before
 * returning, if the platform allows it, so that the renaming trick will not
 * have a problem in a system crash or power failure, where the file could be
 * renamed but the contents never made it from the system file cache to the
 * physical disk.

 * might be half a copy, it might be the untouched data of what was already
 * there, or it might be a zero-byte file, etc.
