/**
 * # CategoryThread
 *
 * SDL offers cross-platform thread management functions. These are mostly
 * concerned with starting threads, setting their priority, and dealing with
 * their termination.
 *
 * In addition, there is support for Thread Local Storage (data that is unique
 * to each thread, but accessed from a single key).
 *
 * On platforms without thread support (such as Emscripten when built without
 * pthreads), these functions still exist, but things like SDL_CreateThread()
 * will report failure without doing anything.
 *
 * If you're going to work with threads, you almost certainly need to have a
 * good understanding of [CategoryMutex](CategoryMutex) as well.

/**
 * Create a new thread with with the specified properties.
 *
 * These are the supported properties:
 *
 * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER`: an SDL_ThreadFunction
 *   value that will be called at the start of the new thread's life.
 *   Required.
 * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING`: the name of the new thread, which
 *   might be available to debuggers. Optional, defaults to NULL.
 * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER`: an arbitrary app-defined
 *   pointer, which is passed to the entry function on the new thread, as its
 *   only parameter. Optional, defaults to NULL.
 * - `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`: the size, in bytes, of the new
 *   thread's stack. Optional, defaults to 0 (system-defined default).
 *
 * SDL makes an attempt to report `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING` to the
 * system, so that debuggers can display it. Not all platforms support this.
 *
 * Thread naming is a little complicated: Most systems have very small limits
 * for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual
 * C++ 6.0 has _nine_!), and possibly other arbitrary rules. You'll have to
 * see what happens with your system's debugger. The name should be UTF-8 (but
 * using the naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet). There are no
 * requirements for thread naming conventions, so long as the string is
 * null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
 *
 * If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it
 * (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available from
 * SDL_GetThreadName().
 *
 * The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with
 * `SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER`. Zero means "use the system
 * default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86 Linux
 * generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device might be a few
 * kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a stack that is a multiple
 * of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but check
 * your system documentation).
 *
 * Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal
 * function with two extra parameters not listed here; they are hidden through
 * preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes at the
 * point of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C
 * headers will need to deal with this.
 *
 * The actual symbol in SDL is `SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime`, so
 * there is no symbol clash, but trying to load an SDL shared library and look
 * for "SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties" will fail.
 *
 * Usually, apps should just call this function the same way on every platform
 * and let the macros hide the details.
 *
