/**
 * # CategoryProperties
 *
 * A property is a variable that can be created and retrieved by name at
 * runtime.
 *
 * All properties are part of a property group (SDL_PropertiesID). A property
 * group can be created with the SDL_CreateProperties function and destroyed
 * with the SDL_DestroyProperties function.
 *
 * Properties can be added to and retrieved from a property group through the
 * following functions:
 *
 * - SDL_SetPointerProperty and SDL_GetPointerProperty operate on `void*`
 *   pointer types.
 * - SDL_SetStringProperty and SDL_GetStringProperty operate on string types.
 * - SDL_SetNumberProperty and SDL_GetNumberProperty operate on signed 64-bit
 *   integer types.
 * - SDL_SetFloatProperty and SDL_GetFloatProperty operate on floating point
 *   types.
 * - SDL_SetBooleanProperty and SDL_GetBooleanProperty operate on boolean
 *   types.
 *
 * Properties can be removed from a group by using SDL_ClearProperty.
