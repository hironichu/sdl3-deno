/**
 * # CategoryThread
 *
 * SDL offers cross-platform thread management functions. These are mostly
 * concerned with starting threads, setting their priority, and dealing with
 * their termination.
 *
 * In addition, there is support for Thread Local Storage (data that is unique
 * to each thread, but accessed from a single key).
 *
 * On platforms without thread support (such as Emscripten when built without
 * pthreads), these functions still exist, but things like SDL_CreateThread()
 * will report failure without doing anything.
 *
 * If you're going to work with threads, you almost certainly need to have a
 * good understanding of [CategoryMutex](CategoryMutex) as well.
