/**
 * # CategoryHaptic
 *
 * The SDL haptic subsystem manages haptic (force feedback) devices.
 *
 * The basic usage is as follows:
 *
 * - Initialize the subsystem (SDL_INIT_HAPTIC).
 * - Open a haptic device.
 * - SDL_OpenHaptic() to open from index.
 * - SDL_OpenHapticFromJoystick() to open from an existing joystick.
 * - Create an effect (SDL_HapticEffect).
 * - Upload the effect with SDL_CreateHapticEffect().
 * - Run the effect with SDL_RunHapticEffect().
 * - (optional) Free the effect with SDL_DestroyHapticEffect().
 * - Close the haptic device with SDL_CloseHaptic().
 *
 * Simple rumble example:
 *
 * ```c
 *    SDL_Haptic *haptic = NULL;
 *
 *    // Open the device
 *    SDL_HapticID *haptics = SDL_GetHaptics(NULL);
 *    if (haptics) {
 *        haptic = SDL_OpenHaptic(haptics[0]);
 *        SDL_free(haptics);
 *    }
 *    if (haptic == NULL)
 *       return;
 *
 *    // Initialize simple rumble
 *    if (!SDL_InitHapticRumble(haptic))
 *       return;
 *
 *    // Play effect at 50% strength for 2 seconds
 *    if (!SDL_PlayHapticRumble(haptic, 0.5, 2000))
 *       return;
 *    SDL_Delay(2000);
 *
 *    // Clean up
 *    SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic);
 * ```
 *
 * Complete example:
 *
 * ```c
 * bool test_haptic(SDL_Joystick *joystick)
 * {
 *    SDL_Haptic *haptic;
 *    SDL_HapticEffect effect;
 *    int effect_id;
 *
 *    // Open the device
 *    haptic = SDL_OpenHapticFromJoystick(joystick);
 *    if (haptic == NULL) return false; // Most likely joystick isn't haptic
 *
 *    // See if it can do sine waves
 *    if ((SDL_GetHapticFeatures(haptic) & SDL_HAPTIC_SINE)==0) {
 *       SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic); // No sine effect
 *       return false;
 *    }
 *
 *    // Create the effect
 *    SDL_memset(&effect, 0, sizeof(SDL_HapticEffect)); // 0 is safe default
 *    effect.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SINE;
 *    effect.periodic.direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // Polar coordinates
 *    effect.periodic.direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Force comes from south
 *    effect.periodic.period = 1000; // 1000 ms
 *    effect.periodic.magnitude = 20000; // 20000/32767 strength
 *    effect.periodic.length = 5000; // 5 seconds long
 *    effect.periodic.attack_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to get max strength
 *    effect.periodic.fade_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to fade away
 *
 *    // Upload the effect
 *    effect_id = SDL_CreateHapticEffect(haptic, &effect);
 *
 *    // Test the effect
 *    SDL_RunHapticEffect(haptic, effect_id, 1);
 *    SDL_Delay(5000); // Wait for the effect to finish
 *
 *    // We destroy the effect, although closing the device also does this
 *    SDL_DestroyHapticEffect(haptic, effect_id);
 *
 *    // Close the device
 *    SDL_CloseHaptic(haptic);
 *
 *    return true; // Success
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the SDL haptic subsystem is not thread-safe.
