/**
 * # CategoryCPUInfo
 *
 * CPU feature detection for SDL.
 *
 * These functions are largely concerned with reporting if the system has
 * access to various SIMD instruction sets, but also has other important info
 * to share, such as system RAM size and number of logical CPU cores.
 *
 * CPU instruction set checks, like SDL_HasSSE() and SDL_HasNEON(), are
 * available on all platforms, even if they don't make sense (an ARM processor
 * will never have SSE and an x86 processor will never have NEON, for example,
 * but these functions still exist and will simply return false in these
 * cases).
