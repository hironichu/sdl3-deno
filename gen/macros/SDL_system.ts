 * Platform-specific SDL API functions. These are functions that deal with
 * needs of specific operating systems, that didn't make sense to offer as
 * platform-independent, generic APIs.
 *
 * Most apps can make do without these functions, but they can be useful for
 * integrating with other parts of a specific system, adding platform-specific
 * polish to an app, or solving problems that only affect one target.
