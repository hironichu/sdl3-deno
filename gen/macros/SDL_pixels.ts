 * # CategoryPixels
 *
 * SDL offers facilities for pixel management.
 *
 * Largely these facilities deal with pixel _format_: what does this set of
 * bits represent?
 *
 * If you mostly want to think of a pixel as some combination of red, green,
 * blue, and maybe alpha intensities, this is all pretty straightforward, and
 * in many cases, is enough information to build a perfectly fine game.
 *
 * However, the actual definition of a pixel is more complex than that:
 *
 * Pixels are a representation of a color in a particular color space.
 *
 * The first characteristic of a color space is the color type. SDL
 * understands two different color types, RGB and YCbCr, or in SDL also
 * referred to as YUV.
 *
 * RGB colors consist of red, green, and blue channels of color that are added
 * together to represent the colors we see on the screen.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model
 *
 * YCbCr colors represent colors as a Y luma brightness component and red and
 * blue chroma color offsets. This color representation takes advantage of the
 * fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness than the color in
 * an image. The Cb and Cr components are often compressed and have lower
 * resolution than the luma component.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr
 *
 * When the color information in YCbCr is compressed, the Y pixels are left at
 * full resolution and each Cr and Cb pixel represents an average of the color
 * information in a block of Y pixels. The chroma location determines where in
 * that block of pixels the color information is coming from.
 *
 * The color range defines how much of the pixel to use when converting a
 * pixel into a color on the display. When the full color range is used, the
 * entire numeric range of the pixel bits is significant. When narrow color
 * range is used, for historical reasons, the pixel uses only a portion of the
 * numeric range to represent colors.
 *
 * The color primaries and white point are a definition of the colors in the
 * color space relative to the standard XYZ color space.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space
 *
 * The transfer characteristic, or opto-electrical transfer function (OETF),
 * is the way a color is converted from mathematically linear space into a
 * non-linear output signals.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709#Transfer_characteristics
 *
 * The matrix coefficients are used to convert between YCbCr and RGB colors.
