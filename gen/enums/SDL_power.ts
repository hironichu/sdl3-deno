 * SDL power management routines.
 *
 * There is a single function in this category: SDL_GetPowerInfo().
 *
 * This function is useful for games on the go. This allows an app to know if
 * it's running on a draining battery, which can be useful if the app wants to
 * reduce processing, or perhaps framerate, to extend the duration of the
 * battery's charge. Perhaps the app just wants to show a battery meter when
 * fullscreen, or alert the user when the power is getting extremely low, so
 * they can save their game.
