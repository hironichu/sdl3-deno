 * # CategoryGamepad
 *
 * SDL provides a low-level joystick API, which just treats joysticks as an
 * arbitrary pile of buttons, axes, and hat switches. If you're planning to
 * write your own control configuration screen, this can give you a lot of
 * flexibility, but that's a lot of work, and most things that we consider
 * "joysticks" now are actually console-style gamepads. So SDL provides the
 * gamepad API on top of the lower-level joystick functionality.
 *
 * The difference between a joystick and a gamepad is that a gamepad tells you
 * _where_ a button or axis is on the device. You don't speak to gamepads in
 * terms of arbitrary numbers like "button 3" or "axis 2" but in standard
 * locations: the d-pad, the shoulder buttons, triggers, A/B/X/Y (or
 * X/O/Square/Triangle, if you will).
 *
 * One turns a joystick into a gamepad by providing a magic configuration
 * string, which tells SDL the details of a specific device: when you see this
 * specific hardware, if button 2 gets pressed, this is actually D-Pad Up,
 * etc.
 *
 * SDL has many popular controllers configured out of the box, and users can
 * add their own controller details through an environment variable if it's
 * otherwise unknown to SDL.
 *
 * In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called with the
 * SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD flag. This causes SDL to scan the system for gamepads, and
 * load appropriate drivers.
 *
 * If you would like to receive gamepad updates while the application is in
 * the background, you should set the following hint before calling
 * SDL_Init(): SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS
 *
 * Gamepads support various optional features such as rumble, color LEDs,
 * touchpad, gyro, etc. The support for these features varies depending on the
 * controller and OS support available. You can check for LED and rumble
 * capabilities at runtime by calling SDL_GetGamepadProperties() and checking
 * the various capability properties. You can check for touchpad by calling
 * SDL_GetNumGamepadTouchpads() and check for gyro and accelerometer by
 * calling SDL_GamepadHasSensor().
 *
 * By default SDL will try to use the most capable driver available, but you
 * can tune which OS drivers to use with the various joystick hints in
 * SDL_hints.h.
 *
 * Your application should always support gamepad hotplugging. On some
 * platforms like Xbox, Steam Deck, etc., this is a requirement for
 * certification. On other platforms, like macOS and Windows when using
 * Windows.Gaming.Input, controllers may not be available at startup and will
 * come in at some point after you've started processing events.
