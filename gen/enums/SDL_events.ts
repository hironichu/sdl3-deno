/**
 * # CategoryEvents
 *
 * Event queue management.
 *
 * It's extremely common--often required--that an app deal with SDL's event
 * queue. Almost all useful information about interactions with the real world
 * flow through here: the user interacting with the computer and app, hardware
 * coming and going, the system changing in some way, etc.
 *
 * An app generally takes a moment, perhaps at the start of a new frame, to
 * examine any events that have occured since the last time and process or
 * ignore them. This is generally done by calling SDL_PollEvent() in a loop
 * until it returns false (or, if using the main callbacks, events are
 * provided one at a time in calls to SDL_AppEvent() before the next call to
 * SDL_AppIterate(); in this scenario, the app does not call SDL_PollEvent()
 * at all).
 *
 * There is other forms of control, too: SDL_PeepEvents() has more
 * functionality at the cost of more complexity, and SDL_WaitEvent() can block
 * the process until something interesting happens, which might be beneficial
 * for certain types of programs on low-power hardware. One may also call
 * SDL_AddEventWatch() to set a callback when new events arrive.
 *
 * The app is free to generate their own events, too: SDL_PushEvent allows the
 * app to put events onto the queue for later retrieval; SDL_RegisterEvents
 * can guarantee that these events have a type that isn't in use by other
 * parts of the system.
