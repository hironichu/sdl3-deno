/**
 * # CategoryProcess
 *
 * Process control support.
 *
 * These functions provide a cross-platform way to spawn and manage OS-level
 * processes.
 *
 * You can create a new subprocess with SDL_CreateProcess() and optionally
 * read and write to it using SDL_ReadProcess() or SDL_GetProcessInput() and
 * SDL_GetProcessOutput(). If more advanced functionality like chaining input
 * between processes is necessary, you can use
 * SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties().
 *
 * You can get the status of a created process with SDL_WaitProcess(), or
 * terminate the process with SDL_KillProcess().
 *
 * Don't forget to call SDL_DestroyProcess() to clean up, whether the process
 * process was killed, terminated on its own, or is still running!

/**
 * Description of where standard I/O should be directed when creating a
 * process.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_INHERITED, it will go
 * to the same place as the application's I/O stream. This is the default for
 * standard output and standard error.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_NULL, it is connected
 * to `NUL:` on Windows and `/dev/null` on POSIX systems. This is the default
 * for standard input.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_APP, it is connected
 * to a new SDL_IOStream that is available to the application. Standard input
 * will be available as `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDIN_POINTER` and allows
 * SDL_GetProcessInput(), standard output will be available as
 * `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDOUT_POINTER` and allows SDL_ReadProcess() and
 * SDL_GetProcessOutput(), and standard error will be available as
 * `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDERR_POINTER` in the properties for the created
 * process.
 *
 * If a standard I/O stream is set to SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it is
 * connected to an existing SDL_IOStream provided by the application. Standard
 * input is provided using `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDIN_POINTER`, standard
 * output is provided using `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDOUT_POINTER`, and
 * standard error is provided using `SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDERR_POINTER`
 * in the creation properties. These existing streams should be closed by the
 * application once the new process is created.
 *
 * In order to use an SDL_IOStream with SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT, it must
 * have `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER` or
 * `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER` set. This is true for streams
 * representing files and process I/O.
