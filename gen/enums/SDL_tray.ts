/**
 * # CategoryTray
 *
 * SDL offers a way to add items to the "system tray" (more correctly called
 * the "notification area" on Windows). On platforms that offer this concept,
 * an SDL app can add a tray icon, submenus, checkboxes, and clickable
 * entries, and register a callback that is fired when the user clicks on
 * these pieces.
