/**
 * # CategoryIntrinsics
 *
 * SDL does some preprocessor gymnastics to determine if any CPU-specific
 * compiler intrinsics are available, as this is not necessarily an easy thing
 * to calculate, and sometimes depends on quirks of a system, versions of
 * build tools, and other external forces.
 *
 * Apps including SDL's headers will be able to check consistent preprocessor
 * definitions to decide if it's safe to use compiler intrinsics for a
 * specific CPU architecture. This check only tells you that the compiler is
 * capable of using those intrinsics; at runtime, you should still check if
 * they are available on the current system with the
 * [CPU info functions](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCPUInfo)
 * , such as SDL_HasSSE() or SDL_HasNEON(). Otherwise, the process might crash
 * for using an unsupported CPU instruction.
 *
 * SDL only sets preprocessor defines for CPU intrinsics if they are
 * supported, so apps should check with `#ifdef` and not `#if`.
 *
 * SDL will also include the appropriate instruction-set-specific support
 * headers, so if SDL decides to define SDL_SSE2_INTRINSICS, it will also
 * `#include <emmintrin.h>` as well.
