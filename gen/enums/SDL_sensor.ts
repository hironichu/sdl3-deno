/**
 * # CategorySensor
 *
 * SDL sensor management.
 *
 * These APIs grant access to gyros and accelerometers on various platforms.
 *
 * In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called with the
 * SDL_INIT_SENSOR flag. This causes SDL to scan the system for sensors, and
 * load appropriate drivers.

/**
 * The different sensors defined by SDL.
 *
 * Additional sensors may be available, using platform dependent semantics.
 *
 * Here are the additional Android sensors:
 *
 * https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html#values
 *
 * Accelerometer sensor notes:
 *
 * The accelerometer returns the current acceleration in SI meters per second
 * squared. This measurement includes the force of gravity, so a device at
 * rest will have an value of SDL_STANDARD_GRAVITY away from the center of the
 * earth, which is a positive Y value.
 *
 * - `values[0]`: Acceleration on the x axis
 * - `values[1]`: Acceleration on the y axis
 * - `values[2]`: Acceleration on the z axis
 *
 * For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
 * held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:
 *
 * - -X ... +X : left ... right
 * - -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
 * - -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
 *
 * The accelerometer axis data is not changed when the device is rotated.
 *
 * Gyroscope sensor notes:
 *
 * The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
 * The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is, an
 * observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would see
 * positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
 * counter-clockwise.
 *
 * - `values[0]`: Angular speed around the x axis (pitch)
 * - `values[1]`: Angular speed around the y axis (yaw)
 * - `values[2]`: Angular speed around the z axis (roll)
 *
 * For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
 * held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:
 *
 * - -X ... +X : left ... right
 * - -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
 * - -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
 *
 * The gyroscope axis data is not changed when the device is rotated.
