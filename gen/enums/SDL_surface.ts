/**
 * # CategorySurface
 *
 * SDL surfaces are buffers of pixels in system RAM. These are useful for
 * passing around and manipulating images that are not stored in GPU memory.
 *
 * SDL_Surface makes serious efforts to manage images in various formats, and
 * provides a reasonable toolbox for transforming the data, including copying
 * between surfaces, filling rectangles in the image data, etc.
 *
 * There is also a simple .bmp loader, SDL_LoadBMP(). SDL itself does not
 * provide loaders for various other file formats, but there are several
 * excellent external libraries that do, including its own satellite library,
 * SDL_image:
