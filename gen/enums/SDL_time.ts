/**
 * # CategoryTime
 *
 * SDL realtime clock and date/time routines.
 *
 * There are two data types that are used in this category: SDL_Time, which
 * represents the nanoseconds since a specific moment (an "epoch"), and
 * SDL_DateTime, which breaks time down into human-understandable components:
 * years, months, days, hours, etc.
 *
 * Much of the functionality is involved in converting those two types to
 * other useful forms.
