/**
 * # CategoryTouch
 *
 * SDL offers touch input, on platforms that support it. It can manage
 * multiple touch devices and track multiple fingers on those devices.
 *
 * Touches are mostly dealt with through the event system, in the
 * SDL_EVENT_FINGER_DOWN, SDL_EVENT_FINGER_MOTION, and SDL_EVENT_FINGER_UP
 * events, but there are also functions to query for hardware details, etc.
 *
 * The touch system, by default, will also send virtual mouse events; this can
 * be useful for making a some desktop apps work on a phone without
 * significant changes. For apps that care about mouse and touch input
 * separately, they should ignore mouse events that have a `which` field of
 * SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID.

/**
 * Data about a single finger in a multitouch event.

 * Each touch event is a collection of fingers that are simultaneously in

 * reality), and this struct reports details of the specific fingers.
 *
 * @since This struct is available since SDL 3.2.0.
