 *
 * Audio functionality for the SDL library.
 *
 * All audio in SDL3 revolves around SDL_AudioStream. Whether you want to play
 * or record audio, convert it, stream it, buffer it, or mix it, you're going
 * to be passing it through an audio stream.
 *
 * Audio streams are quite flexible; they can accept any amount of data at a
 * time, in any supported format, and output it as needed in any other format,
 * even if the data format changes on either side halfway through.
 *
 * An app opens an audio device and binds any number of audio streams to it,
 * feeding more data to the streams as available. When the device needs more
 * data, it will pull it from all bound streams and mix them together for
 * playback.
 *
 * Audio streams can also use an app-provided callback to supply data
 * on-demand, which maps pretty closely to the SDL2 audio model.
 *
 * SDL also provides a simple .WAV loader in SDL_LoadWAV (and SDL_LoadWAV_IO
 * if you aren't reading from a file) as a basic means to load sound data into
 * your program.
 *
 * ## Logical audio devices
 *
 * In SDL3, opening a physical device (like a SoundBlaster 16 Pro) gives you a
 * logical device ID that you can bind audio streams to. In almost all cases,
 * logical devices can be used anywhere in the API that a physical device is
 * normally used. However, since each device opening generates a new logical
 * device, different parts of the program (say, a VoIP library, or
 * text-to-speech framework, or maybe some other sort of mixer on top of SDL)
 * can have their own device opens that do not interfere with each other; each
 * logical device will mix its separate audio down to a single buffer, fed to
 * the physical device, behind the scenes. As many logical devices as you like
 * can come and go; SDL will only have to open the physical device at the OS
 * level once, and will manage all the logical devices on top of it
 * internally.
 *
 * One other benefit of logical devices: if you don't open a specific physical
 * device, instead opting for the default, SDL can automatically migrate those
 * logical devices to different hardware as circumstances change: a user
 * plugged in headphones? The system default changed? SDL can transparently
 * migrate the logical devices to the correct physical device seamlessly and
 * keep playing; the app doesn't even have to know it happened if it doesn't
 * want to.
 *
 * ## Simplified audio
 *
 * As a simplified model for when a single source of audio is all that's
 * needed, an app can use SDL_OpenAudioDeviceStream, which is a single
 * function to open an audio device, create an audio stream, bind that stream
 * to the newly-opened device, and (optionally) provide a callback for
 * obtaining audio data. When using this function, the primary interface is
 * the SDL_AudioStream and the device handle is mostly hidden away; destroying
 * a stream created through this function will also close the device, stream
 * bindings cannot be changed, etc. One other quirk of this is that the device
 * is started in a _paused_ state and must be explicitly resumed; this is
 * partially to offer a clean migration for SDL2 apps and partially because
 * the app might have to do more setup before playback begins; in the
 * non-simplified form, nothing will play until a stream is bound to a device,
 * so they start _unpaused_.
 *
 * ## Channel layouts
 *
 * Audio data passing through SDL is uncompressed PCM data, interleaved. One
 * can provide their own decompression through an MP3, etc, decoder, but SDL
 * does not provide this directly. Each interleaved channel of data is meant
 * to be in a specific order.
 *
 * Abbreviations:
 *
 * - FRONT = single mono speaker
 * - FL = front left speaker
 * - FR = front right speaker
 * - FC = front center speaker
 * - BL = back left speaker
 * - BR = back right speaker
 * - SR = surround right speaker
 * - SL = surround left speaker
 * - BC = back center speaker
 * - LFE = low-frequency speaker
 *
 * These are listed in the order they are laid out in memory, so "FL, FR"
 * means "the front left speaker is laid out in memory first, then the front
 * right, then it repeats for the next audio frame".
 *
 * - 1 channel (mono) layout: FRONT
 * - 2 channels (stereo) layout: FL, FR
 * - 3 channels (2.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE
 * - 4 channels (quad) layout: FL, FR, BL, BR
 * - 5 channels (4.1) layout: FL, FR, LFE, BL, BR
 * - 6 channels (5.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR (last two can also be
 *   SL, SR)
 * - 7 channels (6.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BC, SL, SR
 * - 8 channels (7.1) layout: FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR
 *
 * This is the same order as DirectSound expects, but applied to all
 * platforms; SDL will swizzle the channels as necessary if a platform expects
 * something different.
 *
 * SDL_AudioStream can also be provided channel maps to change this ordering
 * to whatever is necessary, in other audio processing scenarios.
