 *
 * SDL surfaces are buffers of pixels in system RAM. These are useful for
 * passing around and manipulating images that are not stored in GPU memory.
 *
 * SDL_Surface makes serious efforts to manage images in various formats, and
 * provides a reasonable toolbox for transforming the data, including copying
 * between surfaces, filling rectangles in the image data, etc.
 *
 * There is also a simple .bmp loader, SDL_LoadBMP(). SDL itself does not
 * provide loaders for various other file formats, but there are several
 * excellent external libraries that do, including its own satellite library,
 * SDL_image:

/**
 * A collection of pixels used in software blitting.
 *
 * Pixels are arranged in memory in rows, with the top row first. Each row
 * occupies an amount of memory given by the pitch (sometimes known as the row
 * stride in non-SDL APIs).
 *
 * Within each row, pixels are arranged from left to right until the width is
 * reached. Each pixel occupies a number of bits appropriate for its format,
 * with most formats representing each pixel as one or more whole bytes (in
 * some indexed formats, instead multiple pixels are packed into each byte),
 * and a byte order given by the format. After encoding all pixels, any
 * remaining bytes to reach the pitch are used as padding to reach a desired
 * alignment, and have undefined contents.
 *
 * When a surface holds YUV format data, the planes are assumed to be
 * contiguous without padding between them, e.g. a 32x32 surface in NV12
 * format with a pitch of 32 would consist of 32x32 bytes of Y plane followed
 * by 32x16 bytes of UV plane.
 *
 * When a surface holds MJPG format data, pixels points at the compressed JPEG
 * image and pitch is the length of that data.
 *
 * @since This struct is available since SDL 3.2.0.
