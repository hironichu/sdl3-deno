 * # CategoryCamera
 *
 * Video capture for the SDL library.
 *
 * This API lets apps read input from video sources, like webcams. Camera
 * devices can be enumerated, queried, and opened. Once opened, it will
 * provide SDL_Surface objects as new frames of video come in. These surfaces
 * can be uploaded to an SDL_Texture or processed as pixels in memory.
 *
 * Several platforms will alert the user if an app tries to access a camera,
 * and some will present a UI asking the user if your application should be
 * allowed to obtain images at all, which they can deny. A successfully opened
 * camera will not provide images until permission is granted. Applications,
 * after opening a camera device, can see if they were granted access by
 * either polling with the SDL_GetCameraPermissionState() function, or waiting
 * for an SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_APPROVED or SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_DENIED
 * event. Platforms that don't have any user approval process will report
 * approval immediately.
 *
 * Note that SDL cameras only provide video as individual frames; they will
 * not provide full-motion video encoded in a movie file format, although an
 * app is free to encode the acquired frames into any format it likes. It also
 * does not provide audio from the camera hardware through this API; not only
 * do many webcams not have microphones at all, many people--from streamers to
 * people on Zoom calls--will want to use a separate microphone regardless of
 * the camera. In any case, recorded audio will be available through SDL's
 * audio API no matter what hardware provides the microphone.
 *
 * ## Camera gotchas
 *
 * Consumer-level camera hardware tends to take a little while to warm up,
 * once the device has been opened. Generally most camera apps have some sort
 * of UI to take a picture (a button to snap a pic while a preview is showing,
 * some sort of multi-second countdown for the user to pose, like a photo
 * booth), which puts control in the users' hands, or they are intended to
 * stay on for long times (Pokemon Go, etc).
 *
 * It's not uncommon that a newly-opened camera will provide a couple of
 * completely black frames, maybe followed by some under-exposed images. If
 * taking a single frame automatically, or recording video from a camera's
 * input without the user initiating it from a preview, it could be wise to
 * drop the first several frames (if not the first several _seconds_ worth of
 * frames!) before using images from a camera.
