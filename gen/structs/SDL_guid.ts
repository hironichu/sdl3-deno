 * An SDL_GUID is a 128-bit identifier for an input device that identifies

 * If the device is detached and then re-attached to a different port, or if

 * GUIDs are as precise as possible but are not guaranteed to distinguish
 * physically distinct but equivalent devices. For example, two game
 * controllers from the same vendor with the same product ID and revision may
 * have the same GUID.
 *
