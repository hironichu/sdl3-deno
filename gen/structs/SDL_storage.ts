/**
 * # CategoryStorage
 *
 * The storage API is a high-level API designed to abstract away the
 * portability issues that come up when using something lower-level (in SDL's
 * case, this sits on top of the [Filesystem](CategoryFilesystem) and
 * [IOStream](CategoryIOStream) subsystems). It is significantly more
 * restrictive than a typical filesystem API, for a number of reasons:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** A common pitfall with existing filesystem APIs is
 * the assumption that all storage is monolithic. However, many other
 * platforms (game consoles in particular) are more strict about what _type_
 * of filesystem is being accessed; for example, game content and user data
 * are usually two separate storage devices with entirely different
 * characteristics (and possibly different low-level APIs altogether!).
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** Another common mistake is applications assuming that
 * all storage is universally writeable - again, many platforms treat game
 * content and user data as two separate storage devices, and only user data
 * is writeable while game content is read-only.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** The most common portability issue with filesystem
 * access is _timing_ - you cannot always assume that the storage device is
 * always accessible all of the time, nor can you assume that there are no
 * limits to how long you have access to a particular device.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```c
 * void ReadGameData(void)
 * {
 *     extern char** fileNames;
 *     extern size_t numFiles;
 *     for (size_t i = 0; i < numFiles; i += 1) {
 *         FILE *data = fopen(fileNames[i], "rwb");
 *         if (data == NULL) {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         } else {
 *             // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *             fclose(data);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void ReadSave(void)
 * {
 *     FILE *save = fopen("saves/save0.sav", "rb");
 *     if (save == NULL) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     } else {
 *         // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         fclose(save);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * void WriteSave(void)
 * {
 *     FILE *save = fopen("saves/save0.sav", "wb");
 *     if (save == NULL) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     } else {
 *         // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         fclose(save);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Going over the bullet points again:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** This code accesses a global filesystem; game data
 * and saves are all presumed to be in the current working directory (which
 * may or may not be the game's installation folder!).
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** This code assumes that content paths are writeable,
 * and that save data is also writeable despite being in the same location as
 * the game data.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** This code assumes that they can be called at any
 * time, since the filesystem is always accessible and has no limits on how
 * long the filesystem is being accessed.
 *
 * Due to these assumptions, the filesystem code is not portable and will fail
 * under these common scenarios:
 *
 * - The game is installed on a device that is read-only, both content loading
 *   and game saves will fail or crash outright
 * - Game/User storage is not implicitly mounted, so no files will be found
 *   for either scenario when a platform requires explicitly mounting
 *   filesystems
 * - Save data may not be safe since the I/O is not being flushed or
 *   validated, so an error occurring elsewhere in the program may result in
 *   missing/corrupted save data
 *
 * When using SDL_Storage, these types of problems are virtually impossible to
 * trip over:
 *
 * ```c
 * void ReadGameData(void)
 * {
 *     extern char** fileNames;
 *     extern size_t numFiles;
 *
 *     SDL_Storage *title = SDL_OpenTitleStorage(NULL, 0);
 *     if (title == NULL) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!SDL_StorageReady(title)) {
 *         SDL_Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     for (size_t i = 0; i < numFiles; i += 1) {
 *         void* dst;
 *         Uint64 dstLen = 0;
 *
 *         if (SDL_GetStorageFileSize(title, fileNames[i], &dstLen) && dstLen > 0) {
 *             dst = SDL_malloc(dstLen);
 *             if (SDL_ReadStorageFile(title, fileNames[i], dst, dstLen)) {
 *                 // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *             } else {
 *                 // Something bad happened!
 *             }
 *             SDL_free(dst);
 *         } else {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     SDL_CloseStorage(title);
 * }
 *
 * void ReadSave(void)
 * {
 *     SDL_Storage *user = SDL_OpenUserStorage("libsdl", "Storage Example", 0);
 *     if (user == NULL) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!SDL_StorageReady(user)) {
 *         SDL_Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     Uint64 saveLen = 0;
 *     if (SDL_GetStorageFileSize(user, "save0.sav", &saveLen) && saveLen > 0) {
 *         void* dst = SDL_malloc(saveLen);
 *         if (SDL_ReadStorageFile(user, "save0.sav", dst, saveLen)) {
 *             // A bunch of stuff happens here
 *         } else {
 *             // Something bad happened!
 *         }
 *         SDL_free(dst);
 *     } else {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *
 *     SDL_CloseStorage(user);
 * }
 *
 * void WriteSave(void)
 * {
 *     SDL_Storage *user = SDL_OpenUserStorage("libsdl", "Storage Example", 0);
 *     if (user == NULL) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *     while (!SDL_StorageReady(user)) {
 *         SDL_Delay(1);
 *     }
 *
 *     extern void *saveData; // A bunch of stuff happened here...
 *     extern Uint64 saveLen;
 *     if (!SDL_WriteStorageFile(user, "save0.sav", saveData, saveLen)) {
 *         // Something bad happened!
 *     }
 *
 *     SDL_CloseStorage(user);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note the improvements that SDL_Storage makes:
 *
 * 1. **What to Access:** This code explicitly reads from a title or user
 * storage device based on the context of the function.
 *
 * 2. **How to Access:** This code explicitly uses either a read or write
 * function based on the context of the function.
 *
 * 3. **When to Access:** This code explicitly opens the device when it needs
 * to, and closes it when it is finished working with the filesystem.
 *
 * The result is an application that is significantly more robust against the
 * increasing demands of platforms and their filesystems!
 *
 * A publicly available example of an SDL_Storage backend is the
 * [Steam Cloud](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud)
 * backend - you can initialize Steamworks when starting the program, and then
 * SDL will recognize that Steamworks is initialized and automatically use
 * ISteamRemoteStorage when the application opens user storage. More
 * importantly, when you _open_ storage it knows to begin a "batch" of
 * filesystem operations, and when you _close_ storage it knows to end and
 * flush the batch. This is used by Steam to support
 * [Dynamic Cloud Sync](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3142949576401813670)
 * ; users can save data on one PC, put the device to sleep, and then continue
 * playing on another PC (and vice versa) with the save data fully
 * synchronized across all devices, allowing for a seamless experience without
 * having to do full restarts of the program.
 *
 * ## Notes on valid paths
 *
 * All paths in the Storage API use Unix-style path separators ('/'). Using a
 * different path separator will not work, even if the underlying platform
 * would otherwise accept it. This is to keep code using the Storage API
 * portable between platforms and Storage implementations and simplify app
 * code.
 *
 * Paths with relative directories ("." and "..") are forbidden by the Storage
 * API.
 *
 * All valid UTF-8 strings (discounting the NULL terminator character and the
 * '/' path separator) are usable for filenames, however, an underlying
 * Storage implementation may not support particularly strange sequences and
 * refuse to create files with those names, etc.
