/**
 * # CategoryAssert
 *
 * A helpful assertion macro!
 *
 * SDL assertions operate like your usual `assert` macro, but with some added
 * features:
 *
 * - It uses a trick with the `sizeof` operator, so disabled assertions
 *   vaporize out of the compiled code, but variables only referenced in the
 *   assertion won't trigger compiler warnings about being unused.
 * - It is safe to use with a dangling-else: `if (x) SDL_assert(y); else
 *   do_something();`
 * - It works the same everywhere, instead of counting on various platforms'
 *   compiler and C runtime to behave.
 * - It provides multiple levels of assertion (SDL_assert, SDL_assert_release,
 *   SDL_assert_paranoid) instead of a single all-or-nothing option.
 * - It offers a variety of responses when an assertion fails (retry, trigger
 *   the debugger, abort the program, ignore the failure once, ignore it for
 *   the rest of the program's run).
 * - It tries to show the user a dialog by default, if possible, but the app
 *   can provide a callback to handle assertion failures however they like.
 * - It lets failed assertions be retried. Perhaps you had a network failure
 *   and just want to retry the test after plugging your network cable back
 *   in? You can.
 * - It lets the user ignore an assertion failure, if there's a harmless
 *   problem that one can continue past.
 * - It lets the user mark an assertion as ignored for the rest of the
 *   program's run; if there's a harmless problem that keeps popping up.
 * - It provides statistics and data on all failed assertions to the app.
 * - It allows the default assertion handler to be controlled with environment
 *   variables, in case an automated script needs to control it.
 * - It can be used as an aid to Clang's static analysis; it will treat SDL
 *   assertions as universally true (under the assumption that you are serious
 *   about the asserted claims and that your debug builds will detect when
 *   these claims were wrong). This can help the analyzer avoid false
 *   positives.
 *
 * To use it: compile a debug build and just sprinkle around tests to check
 * your code!
