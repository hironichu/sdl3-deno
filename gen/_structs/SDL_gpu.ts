 *
 * The GPU API offers a cross-platform way for apps to talk to modern graphics
 * hardware. It offers both 3D graphics and compute support, in the style of
 * Metal, Vulkan, and Direct3D 12.
 *
 * A basic workflow might be something like this:
 *
 * The app creates a GPU device with SDL_CreateGPUDevice(), and assigns it to
 * a window with SDL_ClaimWindowForGPUDevice()--although strictly speaking you
 * can render offscreen entirely, perhaps for image processing, and not use a
 * window at all.
 *
 * Next, the app prepares static data (things that are created once and used
 * over and over). For example:
 *
 * - Shaders (programs that run on the GPU): use SDL_CreateGPUShader().
 * - Vertex buffers (arrays of geometry data) and other rendering data: use
 *   SDL_CreateGPUBuffer() and SDL_UploadToGPUBuffer().
 * - Textures (images): use SDL_CreateGPUTexture() and
 *   SDL_UploadToGPUTexture().
 * - Samplers (how textures should be read from): use SDL_CreateGPUSampler().
 * - Render pipelines (precalculated rendering state): use
 *   SDL_CreateGPUGraphicsPipeline()
 *
 * To render, the app creates one or more command buffers, with
 * SDL_AcquireGPUCommandBuffer(). Command buffers collect rendering
 * instructions that will be submitted to the GPU in batch. Complex scenes can
 * use multiple command buffers, maybe configured across multiple threads in
 * parallel, as long as they are submitted in the correct order, but many apps
 * will just need one command buffer per frame.
 *
 * Rendering can happen to a texture (what other APIs call a "render target")
 * or it can happen to the swapchain texture (which is just a special texture
 * that represents a window's contents). The app can use
 * SDL_WaitAndAcquireGPUSwapchainTexture() to render to the window.
 *
 * Rendering actually happens in a Render Pass, which is encoded into a
 * command buffer. One can encode multiple render passes (or alternate between
 * render and compute passes) in a single command buffer, but many apps might
 * simply need a single render pass in a single command buffer. Render Passes
 * can render to up to four color textures and one depth texture
 * simultaneously. If the set of textures being rendered to needs to change,
 * the Render Pass must be ended and a new one must be begun.
 *
 * The app calls SDL_BeginGPURenderPass(). Then it sets states it needs for
 * each draw:
 *
 * - SDL_BindGPUGraphicsPipeline()
 * - SDL_SetGPUViewport()
 * - SDL_BindGPUVertexBuffers()
 * - SDL_BindGPUVertexSamplers()
 * - etc
 *
 * Then, make the actual draw commands with these states:
 *
 * - SDL_DrawGPUPrimitives()
 * - SDL_DrawGPUPrimitivesIndirect()
 * - SDL_DrawGPUIndexedPrimitivesIndirect()
 * - etc
 *
 * After all the drawing commands for a pass are complete, the app should call
 * SDL_EndGPURenderPass(). Once a render pass ends all render-related state is
 * reset.
 *
 * The app can begin new Render Passes and make new draws in the same command
 * buffer until the entire scene is rendered.
 *
 * Once all of the render commands for the scene are complete, the app calls
 * SDL_SubmitGPUCommandBuffer() to send it to the GPU for processing.
 *
 * If the app needs to read back data from texture or buffers, the API has an
 * efficient way of doing this, provided that the app is willing to tolerate
 * some latency. When the app uses SDL_DownloadFromGPUTexture() or
 * SDL_DownloadFromGPUBuffer(), submitting the command buffer with
 * SDL_SubmitGPUCommandBufferAndAcquireFence() will return a fence handle that
 * the app can poll or wait on in a thread. Once the fence indicates that the
 * command buffer is done processing, it is safe to read the downloaded data.
 * Make sure to call SDL_ReleaseGPUFence() when done with the fence.
 *
 * The API also has "compute" support. The app calls SDL_BeginGPUComputePass()
 * with compute-writeable textures and/or buffers, which can be written to in
 * a compute shader. Then it sets states it needs for the compute dispatches:
 *
 * - SDL_BindGPUComputePipeline()
 * - SDL_BindGPUComputeStorageBuffers()
 * - SDL_BindGPUComputeStorageTextures()
 *
 * Then, dispatch compute work:
 *
 * - SDL_DispatchGPUCompute()
 *
 * For advanced users, this opens up powerful GPU-driven workflows.
 *
 * Graphics and compute pipelines require the use of shaders, which as
 * mentioned above are small programs executed on the GPU. Each backend
 * (Vulkan, Metal, D3D12) requires a different shader format. When the app
 * creates the GPU device, the app lets the device know which shader formats
 * the app can provide. It will then select the appropriate backend depending
 * on the available shader formats and the backends available on the platform.
 * When creating shaders, the app must provide the correct shader format for
 * the selected backend. If you would like to learn more about why the API
 * works this way, there is a detailed
 * [blog post](https://moonside.games/posts/layers-all-the-way-down/)
 * explaining this situation.
 *
 * It is optimal for apps to pre-compile the shader formats they might use,
 * but for ease of use SDL provides a separate project,
 * [SDL_shadercross](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shadercross)
 * , for performing runtime shader cross-compilation. It also has a CLI
 * interface for offline precompilation as well.
 *
 * This is an extremely quick overview that leaves out several important
 * details. Already, though, one can see that GPU programming can be quite
 * complex! If you just need simple 2D graphics, the
 * [Render API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)
 * is much easier to use but still hardware-accelerated. That said, even for
 * 2D applications the performance benefits and expressiveness of the GPU API
 * are significant.
 *
 * The GPU API targets a feature set with a wide range of hardware support and
 * ease of portability. It is designed so that the app won't have to branch
 * itself by querying feature support. If you need cutting-edge features with
 * limited hardware support, this API is probably not for you.
 *
 * Examples demonstrating proper usage of this API can be found
 * [here](https://github.com/TheSpydog/SDL_gpu_examples)
 * .
 *
 * ## Performance considerations
 *
 * Here are some basic tips for maximizing your rendering performance.
 *
 * - Beginning a new render pass is relatively expensive. Use as few render
 *   passes as you can.
 * - Minimize the amount of state changes. For example, binding a pipeline is
 *   relatively cheap, but doing it hundreds of times when you don't need to
 *   will slow the performance significantly.
 * - Perform your data uploads as early as possible in the frame.
 * - Don't churn resources. Creating and releasing resources is expensive.
 *   It's better to create what you need up front and cache it.
 * - Don't use uniform buffers for large amounts of data (more than a matrix
 *   or so). Use a storage buffer instead.
 * - Use cycling correctly. There is a detailed explanation of cycling further
 *   below.
 * - Use culling techniques to minimize pixel writes. The less writing the GPU
 *   has to do the better. Culling can be a very advanced topic but even
 *   simple culling techniques can boost performance significantly.
 *
 * In general try to remember the golden rule of performance: doing things is
 * more expensive than not doing things. Don't Touch The Driver!
 *
 * ## FAQ
 *
 * **Question: When are you adding more advanced features, like ray tracing or
 * mesh shaders?**
 *
 * Answer: We don't have immediate plans to add more bleeding-edge features,
 * but we certainly might in the future, when these features prove worthwhile,
 * and reasonable to implement across several platforms and underlying APIs.
 * So while these things are not in the "never" category, they are definitely
 * not "near future" items either.
 *
 * **Question: Why is my shader not working?**
 *
 * Answer: A common oversight when using shaders is not properly laying out
 * the shader resources/registers correctly. The GPU API is very strict with
 * how it wants resources to be laid out and it's difficult for the API to
 * automatically validate shaders to see if they have a compatible layout. See
 * the documentation for SDL_CreateGPUShader() and
 * SDL_CreateGPUComputePipeline() for information on the expected layout.
 *
 * Another common issue is not setting the correct number of samplers,
 * textures, and buffers in SDL_GPUShaderCreateInfo. If possible use shader
 * reflection to extract the required information from the shader
 * automatically instead of manually filling in the struct's values.
 *
 * **Question: My application isn't performing very well. Is this the GPU
 * API's fault?**
 *
 * Answer: No. Long answer: The GPU API is a relatively thin layer over the
 * underlying graphics API. While it's possible that we have done something
 * inefficiently, it's very unlikely especially if you are relatively
 * inexperienced with GPU rendering. Please see the performance tips above and
 * make sure you are following them. Additionally, tools like RenderDoc can be
 * very helpful for diagnosing incorrect behavior and performance issues.
 *
 * ## System Requirements
 *
 * **Vulkan:** Supported on Windows, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and certain
 * Android devices. Requires Vulkan 1.0 with the following extensions and
 * device features:
 *
 * - `VK_KHR_swapchain`
 * - `VK_KHR_maintenance1`
 * - `independentBlend`
 * - `imageCubeArray`
 * - `depthClamp`
 * - `shaderClipDistance`
 * - `drawIndirectFirstInstance`
 *
 * **D3D12:** Supported on Windows 10 or newer, Xbox One (GDK), and Xbox
 * Series X|S (GDK). Requires a GPU that supports DirectX 12 Feature Level
 * 11_1.
 *
 * **Metal:** Supported on macOS 10.14+ and iOS/tvOS 13.0+. Hardware
 * requirements vary by operating system:
 *
 * - macOS requires an Apple Silicon or
 *   [Intel Mac2 family](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlfeatureset/mtlfeatureset_macos_gpufamily2_v1?language=objc)
 *   GPU
 * - iOS/tvOS requires an A9 GPU or newer
 * - iOS Simulator and tvOS Simulator are unsupported
 *
 * ## Uniform Data
 *
 * Uniforms are for passing data to shaders. The uniform data will be constant
 * across all executions of the shader.
 *
 * There are 4 available uniform slots per shader stage (where the stages are
 * vertex, fragment, and compute). Uniform data pushed to a slot on a stage
 * keeps its value throughout the command buffer until you call the relevant
 * Push function on that slot again.
 *
 * For example, you could write your vertex shaders to read a camera matrix
 * from uniform binding slot 0, push the camera matrix at the start of the
 * command buffer, and that data will be used for every subsequent draw call.
 *
 * It is valid to push uniform data during a render or compute pass.
 *
 * Uniforms are best for pushing small amounts of data. If you are pushing
 * more than a matrix or two per call you should consider using a storage
 * buffer instead.
 *
 * ## A Note On Cycling
 *
 * When using a command buffer, operations do not occur immediately - they
 * occur some time after the command buffer is submitted.
 *
 * When a resource is used in a pending or active command buffer, it is
 * considered to be "bound". When a resource is no longer used in any pending
 * or active command buffers, it is considered to be "unbound".
 *
 * If data resources are bound, it is unspecified when that data will be
 * unbound unless you acquire a fence when submitting the command buffer and
 * wait on it. However, this doesn't mean you need to track resource usage
 * manually.
 *
 * All of the functions and structs that involve writing to a resource have a
 * "cycle" bool. SDL_GPUTransferBuffer, SDL_GPUBuffer, and SDL_GPUTexture all
 * effectively function as ring buffers on internal resources. When cycle is
 * true, if the resource is bound, the cycle rotates to the next unbound
 * internal resource, or if none are available, a new one is created. This
 * means you don't have to worry about complex state tracking and
 * synchronization as long as cycling is correctly employed.
 *
 * For example: you can call SDL_MapGPUTransferBuffer(), write texture data,
 * SDL_UnmapGPUTransferBuffer(), and then SDL_UploadToGPUTexture(). The next
 * time you write texture data to the transfer buffer, if you set the cycle
 * param to true, you don't have to worry about overwriting any data that is
 * not yet uploaded.
 *
 * Another example: If you are using a texture in a render pass every frame,
 * this can cause a data dependency between frames. If you set cycle to true
 * in the SDL_GPUColorTargetInfo struct, you can prevent this data dependency.
 *
 * Cycling will never undefine already bound data. When cycling, all data in
 * the resource is considered to be undefined for subsequent commands until
 * that data is written again. You must take care not to read undefined data.
 *
 * Note that when cycling a texture, the entire texture will be cycled, even
 * if only part of the texture is used in the call, so you must consider the
 * entire texture to contain undefined data after cycling.
 *
 * You must also take care not to overwrite a section of data that has been
 * referenced in a command without cycling first. It is OK to overwrite
 * unreferenced data in a bound resource without cycling, but overwriting a
 * section of data that has already been referenced will produce unexpected
 * results.
