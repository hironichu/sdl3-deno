/**
 * # CategoryVideo
 *
 * SDL's video subsystem is largely interested in abstracting window
 * management from the underlying operating system. You can create windows,
 * manage them in various ways, set them fullscreen, and get events when
 * interesting things happen with them, such as the mouse or keyboard
 * interacting with a window.
 *
 * The video subsystem is also interested in abstracting away some
 * platform-specific differences in OpenGL: context creation, swapping
 * buffers, etc. This may be crucial to your app, but also you are not
 * required to use OpenGL at all. In fact, SDL can provide rendering to those
 * windows as well, either with an easy-to-use
 * [2D API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender)
 * or with a more-powerful
 * [GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU)
 * . Of course, it can simply get out of your way and give you the window
 * handles you need to use Vulkan, Direct3D, Metal, or whatever else you like
 * directly, too.
 *
 * The video subsystem covers a lot of functionality, out of necessity, so it
 * is worth perusing the list of functions just to see what's available, but
 * most apps can get by with simply creating a window and listening for
 * events, so start with SDL_CreateWindow() and SDL_PollEvent().
