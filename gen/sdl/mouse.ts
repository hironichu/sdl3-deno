/**
 * # CategoryMouse
 *
 * Any GUI application has to deal with the mouse, and SDL provides functions
 * to manage mouse input and the displayed cursor.
 *
 * Most interactions with the mouse will come through the event subsystem.
 * Moving a mouse generates an SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION event, pushing a button
 * generates SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DOWN, etc, but one can also query the
 * current state of the mouse at any time with SDL_GetMouseState().
 *
 * For certain games, it's useful to disassociate the mouse cursor from mouse
 * input. An FPS, for example, would not want the player's motion to stop as
 * the mouse hits the edge of the window. For these scenarios, use
 * SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode(), which hides the cursor, grabs mouse input
 * to the window, and reads mouse input no matter how far it moves.
 *
 * Games that want the system to track the mouse but want to draw their own
 * cursor can use SDL_HideCursor() and SDL_ShowCursor(). It might be more
 * efficient to let the system manage the cursor, if possible, using
 * SDL_SetCursor() with a custom image made through SDL_CreateColorCursor(),
 * or perhaps just a specific system cursor from SDL_CreateSystemCursor().
 *
 * SDL can, on many platforms, differentiate between multiple connected mice,
 * allowing for interesting input scenarios and multiplayer games. They can be
 * enumerated with SDL_GetMice(), and SDL will send SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_ADDED and
 * SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_REMOVED events as they are connected and unplugged.
 *
 * Since many apps only care about basic mouse input, SDL offers a virtual
 * mouse device for touch and pen input, which often can make a desktop
 * application work on a touchscreen phone without any code changes. Apps that
 * care about touch/pen separately from mouse input should filter out events
 * with a `which` field of SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID/SDL_PEN_MOUSEID.

/**
 * Capture the mouse and to track input outside an SDL window.
 *
 * Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just

 * capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events, but
 * unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not
 * restrained to your window.
 *
 * This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
 * your application and others on the system--so you should use this function
 * sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to track the
 * mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
 * button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
 * of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
 * probably use SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowMouseGrab(),
 * depending on your goals.
 *
 * While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
 * current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
 * bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
 * for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
 * capture will be disabled automatically.
 *
 * While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
 * `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.
 *
 * Please note that SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the mouse while the
 * user is pressing a button; this is to try and make mouse behavior more
 * consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case of a user
 * dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you are
 * calling SDL_CaptureMouse() only to deal with this situation, you do not
 * have to (although it is safe to do so). If this causes problems for your
 * app, you can disable auto capture by setting the
 * `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_AUTO_CAPTURE` hint to zero.
