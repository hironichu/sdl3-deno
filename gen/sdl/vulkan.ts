/**
 * # CategoryVulkan
 *
 * Functions for creating Vulkan surfaces on SDL windows.
 *
 * For the most part, Vulkan operates independent of SDL, but it benefits from
 * a little support during setup.
 *
 * Use SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions() to get platform-specific bits for
 * creating a VkInstance, then SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr() to get
 * the appropriate function for querying Vulkan entry points. Then
 * SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface() will get you the final pieces you need to
 * prepare for rendering into an SDL_Window with Vulkan.
 *
 * Unlike OpenGL, most of the details of "context" creation and window buffer
 * swapping are handled by the Vulkan API directly, so SDL doesn't provide
 * Vulkan equivalents of SDL_GL_SwapWindow(), etc; they aren't necessary.

/**
 * Dynamically load the Vulkan loader library.
 *
 * This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
 * creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
 * default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.
 *
 * SDL keeps a counter of how many times this function has been successfully
 * called, so it is safe to call this function multiple times, so long as it
 * is eventually paired with an equivalent number of calls to
 * SDL_Vulkan_UnloadLibrary. The `path` argument is ignored unless there is no
 * library currently loaded, and and the library isn't actually unloaded until
 * there have been an equivalent number of calls to SDL_Vulkan_UnloadLibrary.
 *
 * It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead
 * of explicitly loading it at run time. This will work with SDL provided the
 * application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same
 * search path.
 *
 * If you specify a non-NULL `path`, an application should retrieve all of the
 * Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
 * SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr unless you can guarantee `path` points
 * to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.
 *
 * On Apple devices, if `path` is NULL, SDL will attempt to find the
 * `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the Mach-O images of the current
 * process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to
 * link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static
 * library). If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load
 * `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`,
 * `MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK`, and `libMoltenVK.dylib`, in that order. On
 * iOS, SDL will attempt to load `libMoltenVK.dylib`. Applications using a
 * dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its application
 * bundle.
 *
 * On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static libvulkan is not
 * supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or link to a dynamic
 * library version.
 *
 * @param path the platform dependent Vulkan loader library name or NULL.
 * @returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
 *          information.
