/**
 * # CategoryDialog
 *
 * File dialog support.
 *
 * SDL offers file dialogs, to let users select files with native GUI
 * interfaces. There are "open" dialogs, "save" dialogs, and folder selection
 * dialogs. The app can control some details, such as filtering to specific
 * files, or whether multiple files can be selected by the user.
 *
 * Note that launching a file dialog is a non-blocking operation; control
 * returns to the app immediately, and a callback is called later (possibly in
 * another thread) when the user makes a choice.
